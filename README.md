# Simple Chat Application

The Simple Chat Application is a Java-based chat application that enables real-time messaging between a server and multiple clients over a network. The project showcases my proficiency in Java programming, networking concepts, and graphical user interface (GUI) development using Swing.

## Key Features

- **Networking Functionality:** The application uses Java's `Socket` and `ServerSocket` classes to establish network connections between the server and clients, facilitating seamless communication between participants.

- **User-Friendly GUI:** The GUI is designed using Swing components, offering an intuitive and interactive interface for users to exchange messages. The chat messages are displayed in a scrollable text area, and users can input messages through a text field.

- **Real-Time Messaging:** The application implements dynamic message handling using a `KeyListener`. As users type and send messages, they are immediately displayed in the chat area, enabling real-time communication between clients.

## How to Use

1. **Prerequisites:** Make sure you have Java installed on your system.

2. **Clone the Repository:** Use the following command to clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.comAtharva1479/SimpleChatApp.git 

3. **Run the Server:** Open your preferred Java IDE, compile and run the `Server` class to start the server-side of the chat application.

4. **Run the Client:** Compile and run the `Client` class to start the client-side of the chat application.

5. **Start Chatting:** The GUI will open, and you can now begin sending and receiving messages between the server and clients.

## Technologies Used

- Java: Core programming language used to develop the application.
- Swing: Java's GUI toolkit for creating the user interface components.
- Socket Programming: Used to establish network communication between the server and clients.
